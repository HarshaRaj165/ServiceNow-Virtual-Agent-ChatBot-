# 💬 ServiceNow-Virtual-Agent-ChatBot-

This project showcases the design, configuration, and customization of a **Virtual Agent** in ServiceNow, built within a Personal Developer Instance (PDI). The Virtual Agent is configured to handle IT support scenarios (e.g., Outlook issues) using conversational flows, topic blocks, and NLU (Natural Language Understanding) integration.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Virtual Agent setup with custom greeting, fallback, and topic flows  
- ✅ Integration with NLU model for intent and utterance-based conversation handling  
- ✅ Dynamic user responses, knowledge article linking, and automated incident creation  
- ✅ Custom branding and UI styling of the chat interface  
- ✅ Modular topic blocks to enable ticket creation and live agent support

## 🧠 Functionalities Implemented

### 1. **Virtual Agent Configuration**
- Activated necessary plugins:
  - Glide Virtual Agent
  - ITSM Virtual Agent Conversations
- Enabled via Conversational Interface Guided Setup
- Customized greetings, fallback behavior, and branding

### 2. **Custom Topic: Outlook Issue**
- Created a topic named **Outlook Issue**
- Added keywords like “Outlook not working”, “Email issue”, etc.
- Configured user input (choice options), bot responses, and header cards

### 3. **Knowledge Article Integration**
- If issue is common (e.g., Outlook is slow), show a knowledge article
- Ask the user if the issue was resolved using Boolean choice

### 4. **Fallback Path: Create Incident or Live Agent**
- If issue not resolved, bot gives two options:
  - **Create Ticket**: Pass caller & short description to a Topic Block
  - **Live Agent Support**: Transfer to human agent (not shown in demo)

### 5. **Reusable Topic Block: Create Incident**
- Duplicated and customized OOTB Create Incident topic block
- Mapped input variables:
  - Caller (via sys_id)
  - Short description (user input)
- Used JavaScript to create incident via GlideRecord
- Sent confirmation + incident card (with RITM number, state, etc.)

### 6. **NLU Model & Training**
- Created a model named **IT Issues**
- Defined 2 intents: Outlook issue, Teams issue
- Added multiple utterances for each (up to 15)
- Trained and tested the model inside NLU Workbench
- Linked NLU model + Intent to Outlook topic for seamless redirection

### 7. **Branding & UI Customization**
- Customized:
  - Chat header text, logo, avatar
  - Colors for user and bot messages
  - Menu options, loading delays
- Live preview tested inside Guided Setup

## 🧪 Testing & Demo Steps

1. Navigate to Service Portal (`SP`)
2. Open the chat window
3. Type: `Outlook is not responding`
4. Bot triggers “Outlook Issue” topic (via NLU intent)
5. Select issue (e.g., “Outlook is slow”)
6. Bot shows KB article → asks if resolved
7. Click **No**, then choose **Create Ticket**
8. Describe issue (e.g., “Outlook crashes”)
9. Bot creates Incident and shows confirmation card
